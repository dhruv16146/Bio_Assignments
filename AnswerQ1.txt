Gene Expression:Genes are made up of DNA which contains the information about how to make genetic products like protein (with process involving transcription and translation for protein),
				this whole process by which information within DNA about the synthesis of genetic products(protein) is interpreted by cell so as to synthesise protein is known 
				as gene expression.
Gene Expression levels:It is an estimation that corresponds to the m-RNA or protein levels,that will/shall be produced as a result of Gene Expression Phenomenon.


RT-PCR is one of the techniques used for estimation,
	A probe is set b/w DNA and produced RNA molecules
	Each side of the probe at different end contains a fluoroscent material fluorochrome
	Amount of fluoroscene released during reaction is measured so as to estimate the amount of product generated in each cycle
	(quencher and reporter are the terms used for ends of the probe)
	
Z-Score:A z-score for a sample indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of expression in the reference.
		z = (Xi -mean)/standard_deviation
